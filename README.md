# 🗳️ Synvote

**Synvote** is a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof voting platform built on the [Stacks blockchain](https://stacks.co/) using [Clarity smart contracts](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/clarity-overview). Synvote empowers citizens to securely participate in referendums and public policy decisions by leveraging the power of Bitcoin-secured smart contracts.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Synvote is designed to ensure:

- ✅ **Security**: Immutable and transparent vote records on the blockchain.
- ✅ **Anonymity**: Voter identity is protected using zero-knowledge and/or pseudonymous mechanisms.
- ✅ **Fairness**: Results are calculated automatically and are publicly verifiable.
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Anyone with a compatible wallet can vote or propose issues.
- ✅ **Auditability**: Every action is traceable on-chain for maximum accountability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Smart Contract Language**: [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/clarity-overview)
- **Blockchain**: [Stacks](https://stacks.co) (secured by Bitcoin)
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js (or your choice)
- **Wallet**: [Hiro Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet) for user authentication and transaction signing

---

## 📦 Features

- 🗳️ Create and manage public referendums
- 👤 Decentralized voter registration (optional KYC integration)
- 🔐 Encrypted vote casting and tallying
- 📜 Immutable proposal and result records
- 🧠 Smart contract-based vote counting
- 📈 Real-time referendum dashboards (if integrated with an indexer)

---

## 🧱 Architecture

### 1. Clarity Smart Contracts
- **Referendum Contract**: Create referendums, manage metadata, start/end voting phases.
- **Voting Contract**: Record encrypted or open votes, prevent double voting.
- **Tally Contract**: Aggregate and verify results securely.

### 2. Frontend (DApp)
- Connects via Stacks.js to the user's Hiro Wallet
- Allows users to view referendums, vote, and see live results
- Interacts with the Clarity contracts using read/write functions

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm/yarn
- Clarinet (Clarity development toolkit):  
  ```bash
  curl -sSfL https://get.clarinet.io | sh
````

* Hiro Wallet extension

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/synvote.git
cd synvote
```

### Smart Contracts (Clarity)

```bash
cd contracts/
clarinet test           # Run unit tests
clarinet check          # Check contract syntax and logic
clarinet console        # Interact with your contract locally
```

### Frontend (React/Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run dev             # Runs the app locally
```

## ✍️ Example Contract Snippet

```clarity
(define-map votes ((referendum-id uint) (voter principal)) bool)

(define-public (vote (referendum-id uint))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-none (map-get votes { referendum-id: referendum-id, voter: tx-sender })) 
              (err u100))
    (map-set votes { referendum-id: referendum-id, voter: tx-sender } true)
    (ok true)))
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Use **Clarinet** to write and run unit tests for smart contracts.

```bash
clarinet test
```

Tests are located in `contracts/tests/`.
